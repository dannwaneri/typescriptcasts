# TypeScript Overview & Type System

### Intro

when we write typescript code we are really just writing javascript.All the knowledge you have around javascript like arrays, objects, functions and even es15 syntax like destructuring, arrow functions and classes still applies to the world of typescript.

The only thing that we're really doing with typescript is adding in a little bit  additional syntax to our code to handle something called the type system.This is what typescript is all about as you might guess and it's what we're gonna spend the vast majority of this course learning about
let's get a quick overview on the type system and understand what's going on with it.

### Type System 

The goal of the type system is to help us catch errors during development in otherwords when we're actually write our code in our code editor
Think about how we catch errors right now with javascript code.
Let's imagine that you're writing out some amount of javascript inside of your editor and maybe there's a bug and side of it how would you find that bug?
well really with javascript the only way to do that is to actually execute your code and see that errors appear and that's not super efficient.
so as an improvement to the development work flow we use the type system to help us catch errors during development.
